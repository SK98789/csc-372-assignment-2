    This is the index.html page for Assignment 2. It is the index page for a basic travel blog, and it
    links to a destination page.
    The two extra features I have added are favicon and tooltips.

            <p>
                After a long and drawn-out legal battle, I have found myself low on funds. 
                My patrons no longer have interest in funding my work, so this blog will be be heading in a 
                new direction at this point in time. Never fear, for this will still be a travel blog, but I 
                will no longer be visiting the luxurious tourist towns in Europe.
            </p>
            <p> With this in mind, please enjoy the writeup of my latest trip to the humble town of <a href="destination.html">Maxeys, Georgia</a>!</p>

            <h2> Who I Am</h2>
            <p> I am a real travel blogger, and I definitely really exist. This is definitely a real photo of 
                me, and it certainly would not show up on a Google search by typing in "stock photo hipster". </p>
            <p>I am very passionate about travel, as you likely could tell by the name of my blog. 
                I always go to luxury hotels and only like visiting expensive cities overseas.
                 If you cannot afford a $1200/night hotel, don't bother reading this blog, it won't help you.</p>
