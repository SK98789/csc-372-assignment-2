    <h2>Visitor Tips</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If the town's only Bed & Breakfast is all booked up, consider staying in a different
             town and driving in.</li>
        <li>If all other accomodations are booked, consider staying at a campground. 
            Oconee River Campground is only a 10 mile hike away!</li>
        <li>Bring your own backup water reserve on your trip! Depending on town water usage at 
            the time of your visit, the water pressure may drop drastically.</li>
        <li>Consider scheduling your trip to align with a council meeting.</li>
    </ul>
